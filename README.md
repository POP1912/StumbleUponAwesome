__[StumbleUponAwesome]()__ 

A Chrome/Brave extension that takes you to a random site from one of the [awesome curated lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). Like good ol' StumbleUpon (which is now dead). 

There are 50,967 unique sites from 528 awesome collection pages on Github from kind contributors. There's some hidden gems waiting in there. 

Feedback and suggestions welcome!

<small>(pending Google Web store review, but you can load the extension 'unpacked')</small>
