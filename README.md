</p>

> A Chrome/Brave extension that takes you to a random site from one of the [awesome curated lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). Like good ol' StumbleUpon (which is now dead). 

‚ö°Ô∏è [Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stumbleuponawesome/dhfmgppomdaagdcbpccdfjpopgikcdge?authuser=3)


There are 32,443 unique sites from 528 awesome collection pages on Github from kind contributors. There's some hidden gems waiting in there. 

----

## How to use it:
**To stumble:** Simply click on the ‚ö°Ô∏è extension button ‚Üí go to a new awesome site!
<small>(or use **`Alt`** + **`Shift`** +**`S`**)</small>

### Í©ú New: Rabbit hole 

_We have all been down internet rabbit holes_. <br/>
.<br/>
One minute you're casually reading the news, the next you've read so much about `random topic` you might as well do a TED talk. <br/>
.<br/>
_What just happened?_ The rabbit hole pulled you in and you lost track of time, but you also might have discovered something _awesome_. <br/>
.<br/>
So why not embrace it, by having a fancy button for it, _obviously_. **Stay stumblin' on the same topic,** or exit back to random mode.<br/>

- [ ] Feedback mechanism for good/bad links

- [ ] Basic stats
- [ ] Categories
  - [x] [awesome curated lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
